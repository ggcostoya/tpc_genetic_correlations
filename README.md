### **Abstract**

Mounting evidence suggests that evolutionary adaptation may rescue some organisms from rapid climate change. However, evolutionary constraints might hinder this process, especially when different aspects of environmental change generate antagonistic selection on genetically correlated traits. Here, we use individual-based simulations to explore how genetic correlations underlying the thermal physiology of ectotherms might influence their responses to the two major components of climate change—increases in mean temperature and thermal variability—that are happening concurrently in nature. We found that genetic correlations can influence population dynamics under climate change, with declines in population size varying three-fold depending on the type of genetic correlation present. Surprisingly, populations whose thermal performance curves were constrained by genetic correlations often declined less rapidly than those populations which were unconstrained. Our results suggest that accurate forecasts of the impact of climate change on ectotherms will require an understanding of the genetic architecture of the traits under selection

### **Repository structure**

All `R` and `bash` code within this repository can be found in the corresponding folders. Within the `R` folder:

- The subfolder `simulation_scripts` contains scripts (1) to generate populations of varying initial population sizes and subject to different kinds of genetic correlations, (2) to generate temperature sequences following climate change scenarios with specified changes in mean and thermal variability, (3) describing the basic simulation function with and without parallelization, (4) to process the data output from simulation runs. 

- The subfolder `plotting` contains all code necessary to replicate all figures presented in the manuscript.
